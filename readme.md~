## About Linet

Linet is a network operating system that implements a Server-Client structure. The client, which runs in a web browser or application container, allows users to learn, manage contacts, interact, make & modify applications and much more. Linet OS was developed under the Lugha Yetu Project undertaken as an undergraduate project to promote the growth of Kiswahili Language in Africa.

Linet is highly extensible. Its functionality, brought in by applications, allows users to do what they want on a computer.

On the development agenda is "[Maandishi programming language](https://maandishi.lughayetu.net)", a swahili programming language.
